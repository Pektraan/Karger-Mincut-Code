# Karger-Mincut-Code
Code for solving min-cut problem in graphs using Karger's algorithm
This is a C language implementation of Karger's algorithm to find the min cut of a graph given its adjacency list.
It takes as input a text file containing the adjacency lists of the given graph.
This is a very fast implementation using only an elementary structure and an array.
It is easy for a beginner to understand.
